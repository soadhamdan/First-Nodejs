         So begins this hard science fiction novel from
         Canadian author Peter Watts. It is 2082. It is the day of the Fireflies. Sixty-five thousand objects 
         burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. The beginning of an invasion? For two months nothing more is seen or heard.
         Then a deep space probe picks up a whisper at the edge of the solar system.
         Is it talking to us, or is it calling for reinforcements
        The story is narrated by Siri, a synthesist, an observer of patterns and human behaviour.
        <br> The problem is, Siri isn’t entirely human himself. When he was a kid he suffered from epilepsy – 
        so his parents had half his brain cut out. Now he is cold, devoid of feeling, completely lacking 
        in empathy. When the mission to investigate the whispers at the edge of the solar system 
        is first imagined, his father has no hesitation in putting him forward for the job.
        But that, that distance – that chronic sense of being an alien among your own kind – 
        it’s not entirely a bad thing.
        It came in especially handy when the real aliens came calling.<br>
        He is an outcast among outcasts. The other crew members include 
        a linguist with multiple personalities who might be able to communicate with the aliens,
         a soldier sent along to fight, should it be needed, though she’d rather keep the peace, 
         and a vampire . .<br>
        Nobody gets past Jupiter without becoming part vampir<br>
        If the mind boggles at the thought of a vampire in a hard science fiction novel, don’t worry – 
        Watts has it covered. The worldbuilding, the characters, the environment they inhabit,
         the danger they face – it’s all so coherent and consistent and relentlessly logical that it works. 
         Watts carries this consistency through to every facet of the novel. Every sentence has impact,
          the tone and voice is rock solid and never deviates, every line of dialogue fits the setting. 
          The scarily thin hull of their ship, the Theseus, groans and twists with every course change,
           and in his hands this journey to the edge of our solar system becomes an exercise in terror.
            Think Alien by way of Event Horizon and other such films, but with real substance, 
            and real fear.
        Another huge plus point in the book’s favour is he doesn’t waste any time, at all.<br>
         After a brief, riveting prologue we are thrust aboard the Theseus as its crew come out of deep sleep,
          approaching their destination. He emphasises this relentless narrative focus by 
          eschewing conventional chapters, splitting the novel into parts with names like ‘Rorschach’
           and ‘Charybdis’ which, in turn, only serve to make it more intense

        <h3>About The Book</h3>
        It’s up to a famous rapper, a biologist, and a rogue soldier to handle humanity’s first contact
         with an alien ambassador—and
         prevent mass extinction—in this novel that blends magical realism with high-stakes action.
        
        After word gets out on the Internet that aliens have landed in the waters outside of 
        the world’s fifth most populous city, chaos ensues. Soon the military, religious leaders, 
        thieves, and crackpots are trying to control the message on YouTube and on the streets. Meanwhile, 
        the earth’s political superpowers are considering a preemptive nuclear launch to eradicate the 
        intruders. All that stands between seventeen million anarchic residents and death is an alien
         ambassador, a biologist, a rapper, a soldier, and a myth that may be the size of a giant spider, 
         or a god revealed.
        Excerpt<br>
        Lagoon <br>
        
        CHAPTER <br>
        
        FIST<br>
        
        It was an eerie moment as Adaora and the two strange men arrived at that spot, right before it happened. Exactly three yards from the water at exactly 11:55 p.m., 8 January 2010. Adaora came from the north side of the beach. The tall veiled man came from the east. The bloodied man wearing army fatigues from the west. They ambled in their general directions, eyeing each other as it became clear that their paths would intersect.‏
        
        Only Adaora hesitated. Then, like the others, she pressed on. She was a born-and-raised Lagosian, and she was wearing nicely fitted jeans and a sensible blouse. She’d spent more time walking this beach than probably both of these men combined.‏
        
        She wiped the tears from her cheeks and trained her eyes straight ahead. About a quarter of a mile away was open water where the Atlantic overflowed its banks. When bad things happened, her feet always brought her here, to Lagos’s Bar Beach.‏
        
        In many ways, Bar Beach was a perfect sample of Nigerian society. It was a place of mixing. The ocean mixed with the land, and the wealthy mixed with the poor. Bar Beach attracted drug dealers, squatters, various accents and languages, seagulls, garbage, biting flies, tourists, all kinds of religious zealots, hawkers, prostitutes, johns, water-loving children, and their careless parents. The beachside bars and small restaurants were the most popular hangout spots. Bar Beach’s waters were too wild for any serious swimming. Even the best swimmers risked a watery death by its many rip currents.‏
        
        Adaora had removed her sandals. It was deep night, and this was probably a bad idea. So far, however, she hadn’t stepped on any pieces of wood, rusty nails, broken glass, or sharp stones. Her need to feel the cool sand between her toes at this moment outweighed the risk. Despite its trash, there was still something sacred about Bar Beach.‏
        
        On 12 June 1993, the day of the most democratic election in Nigeria’s history, she’d come here with her father and watched him shed tears of joy. On 23 June, her mother brought her here because her father and uncles were at home cursing and shouting over the military annulling those same elections.‏
        
        She came here to escape the reality that her best friend was sleeping with her biology professor to earn a passing grade. On the day she received her PhD in marine biology from the University of Lagos, she came here to thank the Powers That Be for helping her stay sane enough to finish her degree (and for the fact that she hadn’t had to sleep with anyone to earn it).‏
        
        Last year, she’d come here to weep when her father was killed along with thirty others during a botched robbery of a luxury bus on the Lagos–Benin Expressway, one of Nigeria’s many, many, many dangerous roads. The thieves had demanded that all the passengers get off the bus and lie in the momentarily empty road. In their stupidity, the thieves hadn’t anticipated the truck (speeding to avoid armed robbers) that would run over everyone including the thieves.‏
        
        And now Adaora was here at Bar Beach because her loving perfect husband of ten years had hit her. Slapped her really hard. All because of a hip-hop concert and a priest. At first, she’d stood there stunned and hurt, cupping her cheek, praying the children hadn’t heard. Then she’d brought her hand up and slapped him right back. Shocked into rage, her husband leaped on her. But Adaora had been ready for him. By this time, she wasn’t thinking about the children.‏
        
        She didn’t know how long she and her husband had scuffled <br>like wild dogs on the floor. And the way the fight had ended, it wasn’t . . . normal. One minute they’d been brawling, and then the next, her husband was mysteriously stuck to the floor, his wrists and ankles held down as though by powerful magnets. As he’d screamed and twisted, Adaora had got up, grabbed her keys, and run out of the house. Thankfully, their Victoria Island home was only minutes from Bar Beach.‏
        
        She rubbed her swollen cheek. Even on her dark skin, the redness would be visible. She set her jaw, and tried to ignore the two men coming from her right and left as she walked toward the ocean. After what she’d just dealt with, she wasn’t about to let any man get in her way. Still, as she got closer, she ventured a glance at the two of them.‏
        
        She frowned.<br>
        
        The man in the military uniform looked like he’d already seen plenty plenty pepper. He reminded Adaora of a whipped lion. Blood dribbled from his nose, and he wasn’t bothering to wipe it away. And half his face was swollen. Yet he had a hard, unshaken look in his eye. The other man was a tall, dark-skinned scarecrow of a fellow wearing a black-and-white veil. Maybe he was a Muslim. He was scrutinizing the approaching beat-up-looking soldier more than he was her.‏
        
        Each of them walked in their respective straight lines. Each heading toward each other. Adaora squinted at the man in the veil. What is it about him? she thought as she walked toward the sea. Something. But she didn’t slow her gait. And so the three of them met. The tall man was the first to speak. “Excuse—”‏
        
        “Tell me this is a joke,” Adaora interrupted as she realized what it was about the man. “Are . . . are you . . . Can I ask you a . . .”‏
        
        The tall man, looking deeply annoyed, removed his veil and sighed. “I am,” he said, cutting her off. “But don’t call me Anthony Dey Craze. I’m just out for a post-concert stroll. Tonight, just call me Edgar.”‏
        
        “Na woa!” she exclaimed, laughing, reaching up to touch her throbbing cheek. “You wore that scarf on your album cover, didn’t you?” After what had happened at home, it was surprising and felt good to laugh. “I was supposed to be at your concert tonight!”‏
        
        At some point, her husband Chris had changed his mind about “letting” her go to the Anthony Dey Craze concert with her best friend Yemi because he’d barred her way when she’d tried to leave. “Since when do I need your permission to do anything, anyway?” she’d said to her husband, taken aback. Then came the slap.‏
        
        “Please,” the bloody military man said, 
        snatching his green beret off his smoothly shaven head and squeezing it in his shaking hands. 
        “Do either of you have a mobile phone? I must call my father. I will pay you well.
        
        Adaora barely registered his words; she was now really looking him over.
         Up close he looked not only injured but in deep, deep distress.
          The blood running from his nose glistened in the dim mix of street and moonlight. 
          She took her hand from her burning cheek and reached out to him.
        
        “Hey, buddy,” Anthony said, looking at the military man with concern.
         He’d brought out his mobile phone. “You’re bleeding, o! Do you need help? Are you all
        
        “No!” he snapped. “I’m not all right!”<br>
        
        Adaora jumped back, unconsciously bringing her fists up.<br>
        
        “Do I LOOK all right?” he shouted. He motioned for Anthony’s mobile phone. “I need to make this phone call right now! My 
        
        BOOM!<br>
        
        Anthony dropped his mobile phone as all three of them dropped to the ground, their hands over their heads. Adaora found herself looking from the bleeding military man to Anthony in terror. It was not the type of sound one heard on Bar Beach, or in any part of Lagos. On Bar Beach, the loudest thing was typically some woman shouting at a man or someone’s old car backfiring on a nearby road. This booming sound was so deep Adaora could feel it ‏in her chest, and it rattled her teeth. It left cotton in her ears. It was so wide that it seemed to have its own physical weight. Adaora glanced around and saw that the noise pushed everything to the ground. A few feet away, two seagulls dropped from the night sky to the sand, stunned. Something black bounced off Anthony’s head and fell beside him.‏
        
        “Bat?” Adaora asked. Everything was muffled, as if she were speaking underwater.<br>
        
        Anthony looked at it closely. The bat was furry-bodied and beady-eyed with black wings. It wiggled a bit, still alive. He scooped up the poor creature and grabbed Adaora’s hand. He nudged the military man’s shoulder as he cradled the stunned animal.‏
        
        “Come on!” he shouted. “That came from the water! We should get away from here!”<br>
        
        But something was happening to the ocean. The waves were roiling irregularly. Each time the waves broke on the beach, they reached farther and farther up the sand. Then a four-foot wave rose up. Adaora was so fascinated that she just stood there staring. Anthony stopped pulling her and pushing the military man. Blood ran into the military man’s eyes as he tried to focus his gaze on the darkness of the water. The wave was heading right for them. Fast and quiet as a whisper. It was closer to ten feet tall now. Finally, the three of them turned and ran. The fist of water was faster. Adaora grabbed the military man’s hand. Anthony threw the bat to what he hoped was safety, leaped, and grabbed Adaora’s legs just as the water fell at them.‏

<h3>        An Empire Divided
</h3>
    December 17, 2016   •   By Graham J. Murphy<br>
    SPACE OPERA has a long and rich history within science fiction, 
    but it has only started to achieve a degree of recognition and respectability over the last few decades. <br>
    As David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer write in their introduction to The Space Opera Renaissance 
    (2007), the star-spanning subgenre “reentered the serious discourse on contemporary SF in the 1980s” <br>
    and has since permitted writers “to embark on a science fiction project that is ambitious<br>
     in both commercial and literary terms.” This dual ambition is epitomized in Ann Leckie’s
      award-winning Imperial Radch trilogy: Ancillary Justice (2013), <br>
      Ancillary Sword (2014), and Ancillary Mercy (2015). 
      Fans, writers, and critics applaud Leckie’s storytelling skills, and listing her impressive collection<br>
       of awards and award nominations — including Hugos and Nebulas — would overwhelm this review.<br>
        Simply put, the Imperial Radch trilogy deserves its awards and acclaim. The series is a stunning 
        achievement that belongs on anyone’s “must-read” list, even if they aren’t necessarily
        <br> fans of science fiction.
    
    Within the trilogy, far-flung star systems comprise the territory of the Imperial Radch,<br>
     ruled for the past 3,000 years by the authoritarian Lord of the Radch, Anaander Mianaai,<br>
      whose clone bodies and interstellar gates enable her to achieve a distributed consciousness stretching <br>
      across light years. This distributed consciousness is also the source of the empire’s central conflict:<br>
      <br>
       ruling a vast empire is difficult for the Lord of the Radch when “it could take weeks for a thought to <br>
       reach all the way across herself,” an inconvenience that proves increasingly problematic when various
       <br> parts of herself begin plotting against others. Lord Mianaai is quite literally at war with herself<br>
        over the future of the Radch; this schism results partially from her own conflicted feelings about an<br>
         insurrection by the Garsedd star system that ended in the utter destruction of Garsedd and its people,<br>
          triggering Lord Anaander Mianaai’s internal division.<br>
    
    Furthermore, myriad internal and external complications threaten the Radchaai in addition to Lord Mianaai’s<br>
     schismatic condition. First, the empire is beset by resistance to the changing shape of the Radchaai military. There are three classes of starship — ‏Justice‏, Sword‏, and ‏Mercy ‏— and each ship is commanded by human officers; the composition of a ship’s crew, however, is an increasing source of tension within the empire. For thousands of years, the crew had been largely comprised of ancillaries, corporeal extensions of a ship’s central Artificial Intelligence (AI) arranged hierarchically into units under a human commanding officer. In the years prior to the main events of the first novel, however, the Imperial Radch has moved away from ancillaries in favor of human crews. This decision fuels divisions within the military as an increasingly emboldened contingent seeks to abandon human crews and return to the more profitable (and brutally exploitative) ancillary system, which depends upon the conquest of new worlds to harvest the bodies that become enslaved as ancillaries to the Radchaai ship systems.‏
    
    Second, alien threats like the Geck and the Rrrrrr from outside Radchaai space perpetually haunt the empire, but it is the Presger — a vicious and unstoppable species that has defeated the Radchaai in every previous encounter — who are the greatest concern. Although the Presger never actually appear in the series, they conduct their business through envoys or operate behind the scenes. It is the Presger, for example, who not-so-secretly supplied the Garsedd with powerful weaponry to mobilize their failed rebellion against the Radch. Although a truce keeps the Presger from declaring all-out war, there is ongoing speculation that the Presger are directly or indirectly responsible for provoking Lord Anaander Mianaai’s internal schism, which ultimately leads to the Radchaai civil conflict.‏
    
    The adventures of a former ancillary known as Justice of Toren One Esk Nineteen (who simply calls herself Breq) serve as the narrative heart of the series. Threats to the Radchaai empire are intensely personal for Breq: she spent most of her life as an ancillary, but her greater self, ‏Justice of Toren‏, has been destroyed by one version of Anaander Mianaai in a strategic move against another; all that is left to fuel Breq is her rage at every version of the Lord of the Radch. The first book in the trilogy, ‏Ancillary Justice‏, opens 19 years after ‏Justice of Toren‏’s destruction: Breq is on the planet Nilt searching for Arilesperas Strigan, a doctor who hides an unregistered Presger gun in her possession — one that can easily penetrate Radch personal armor and ship shielding. Before Breq can find Dr. Strigan and the gun, however, she stumbles across Seivarden Vendaai, beaten and unconscious in the snow outside a local tavern. Seivarden served with Breq as a lieutenant on the ‏Justice of Toren ‏over 1,000 years earlier until she was promoted to captain the ‏Sword of Nathtas‏: this was a disastrous posting that saw the ‏Sword of Nathtas ‏destroyed and Seivarden trapped in a stasis tube for a millennium. Seivarden is now a shadow of her former self, a temporally displaced officer addicted to kef whose life is wasting away. And, much like Breq, Seivarden finds the current Imperial Radch largely inhospitable: “You lost your ship,” Breq explains to Seivarden. “You were frozen for a thousand years. You wake up to find the Radch has changed — no more invasions, a humiliating treaty with the Presger, your house has lost financial and social status. No one knows you or remembers you, or cares whether you live or die.” Breq could just as easily be talking about herself; she too is lost in an empire she no longer recognizes.‏
    
    Pairing Breq and Seivarden in Ancillary  is key to the former ancillary’s humanization. <br>As Justice of Toren <br>
    One Esk Nineteen, Breq was part of a localized distributed consciousness with access to a vast body of knowledge, but as a displaced survivor of the destruction of her larger self, she experiences herself as a vastly diminished entity. Breq’s story throughout the trilogy involves balancing her quest for vengeance with an exploration of what it means to be human. Breq is a relatively flat protagonist, which shouldn’t be surprising considering she is a lone segment of a powerful AI trapped in a human body; as a result, her feelings often struggle against the cold equations of the artificial logic that once governed her existence. Breq can be an off-putting character at times, demonstrating minimal levels of emotional warmth, although she warms up considerably as the trilogy continues. Seivarden helps to thaw Breq out of her isolationism: for reasons unknown even to the former AI segment, Breq bonds with Seivarden, and in so doing, she slowly learns about her own humanity, particularly when Breq risks her life and incurs a leg injury to save Seivarden from a fall off an ice bridge. As ‏Ancillary Justice ‏draws to a close, Seivarden has developed a fierce loyalty to Breq, all the while unaware that Breq is the last remaining segment of ‏Justice of Toren‏. This loyalty remains unwavering throughout the remaining two books, particularly in ‏Ancillary Mercy‏. At the same time, Breq develops a sense of responsibility for Seivarden. This relationship between two broken characters allows Leckie to explore questions of identity, loyalty, and addiction. Over the course of the trilogy, the two slowly piece their lives together, and although Breq is stronger in handling her fractures, they both come to rely upon one another in unexpected ways.‏ 
    
    Ancillary Justice 
    <br>also introduces key narrative strategies that help explain why the Imperial Radch trilogy has achieved its stunning success. First, Leckie refuses to allow biological sex to dictate characterization or unduly influence our reading practices. The Radchaai language doesn’t differentiate sex or gender, so Breq makes no distinctions; at the same time, the narrative refers to everyone largely as ‏she‏ and ‏her‏ regardless of biological sex. In a blog entry reposted on the Virago website, Leckie admits she didn’t mean‏
    to examine how the use of gendered pronouns shapes our thoughts about the people around us, really I didn’t. But then, isn’t that one of the things science fiction is for, what it excels at? Imagining strange and unfamiliar worlds, that maybe give us a new and interesting way to think about our own?‏
    
    The use of a universalizing <br>she<br>as the default pronoun throughout the series, Leckie explains,<br>
    suddenly made the fact that there was a default visible. The thing about defaults is, they’re automatic. Most of the time you don’t even think about them. They just seem quite obvious and natural. Using an unusual default, particularly one that’s close to but not exactly like the usual one, really highlights the fact that there’s a default there to begin with.‏
    
    These “default moments” are particularly notable when Breq is communicating with someone whose language makes gender distinctions and she struggles to find the correct designation. For example, Breq looks at a bar patron on one world and deduces the following:‏
    She was probably male, to judge from the angular mazelike patterns quilting her shirt. I wasn’t entirely certain. It wouldn’t have mattered, if I had been in Radch space. Radchaai don’t care much about gender, and the language they speak — my own first language — doesn’t mark gender in any way. This language we were speaking now did, and I could make trouble for myself if I used the wrong forms. It didn’t help that cues meant to distinguish gender changed from place to place, sometimes radically, and rarely made much sense to me.‏
    
    Although there are subtle cues attached to some characters that readers can use to figure out biological sex, it is largely a wasted endeavor: the use of a universal feminine pronoun becomes entirely normalized in a trilogy that offers striking challenges to gender norms and assumptions, even if the novel isn’t directly ‏about ‏sex and gender.‏
    
    The second narrative strategy depends on what a distributed consciousness allows Leckie to do vis-à-vis point of view and narrative voice. The Imperial Radch trilogy is essentially a first-person narrative, but Leckie repeatedly employs the freedoms associated with third-person narration, particularly in ‏Ancillary Sword ‏and ‏Ancillary Mercy‏. For example, at the end of ‏Ancillary Justice‏, Breq has manipulated one version of Mianaai to secure not only a ship but also a significant military posting, which takes the now Fleet Captain Breq Mianaai to Athoek Station, the setting for the bulk of ‏Ancillary Sword ‏and ‏Ancillary Mercy‏. Having connected to ‏Mercy‏ of Kalr‏’s AI and the ‏Mercy‏’s crew, Breq (and the reader) can experience what is happening to members of her crew located anywhere else in the setting, whether in different parts of a spaceship, on different spaceships or space stations, or even off-planet. These at-times-jarring shifts in points of view unashamedly make demands upon the reader’s attention, but those demands are well worth the effort: they provide a narrative scope that remains grounded in the experiences of its protagonist while offering Leckie the luxuries (and advantages) afforded to a third-person perspective.‏
    
    The events in Ancillary Sword (and Ancillary Mercy) also open the series up to sociopolitical considerations that Ancillary Justice only hints at. Annexation by the Imperial Radch represents imperialism in its most brutal form: systems have been forcibly inducted into the Radch empire, and “uncivilized” elements — such as opposing military forces, rabble-rousers, and anyone who might cause friction — have been converted into ancillary drones in service to the empire. Annexations and ancillaries have been phased out, but the strong contingent of Radchaai who yearn for the practices of yesteryear believe the empire has consequently grown weak. Only a strong empire, they argue, can defend itself against such dangerous forces as the alien Presger, should the marauding aliens ever decide to break their treaty. At the same time, an economic dimension surrounds annexation and ancillary bodies: “Expansion, annexation” as one Mianaai explains to ‏Justice of Toren ‏One Var,‏
    is very expensive. Necessary — it has been from the beginning. From the first, to surround the Radch itself with a buffer zone,<br> protecting it from any sort of attack or interference. Later, to protect ‏those ‏citizens. And to expand the reach of civilization. […] To pay for the previous annexations. To provide wealth for Radchaai in general.‏
    
    The civil war between different factions within Anaander Mianaai is therefore a complex ideological battle that includes interstellar economics, objections to annexations and ancillaries, imperial defense from opposing alien forces, and moral schisms that collectively provide Leckie the opportunity to theorize on the legacies of imperialism and strategies of postcolonial resistance.‏
    
    Just as speaking of a supposedly “postcolonial” national context is problematic for indigenous peoples living under the ongoing legacy of colonial occupation, so too is the continuing operation of imperial power an ongoing topic in ‏Ancillary Sword‏ and, to a lesser extent, ‏Ancillary Mercy‏. Ancillary Sword ‏can be divided into roughly two sections: the first involves internal conflicts that greet Fleet Captain Breq Mianaai when she arrives at Athoek Station; the second involves worker exploitation and labor disputes on the planet Athoek. “Theoretically, when the Radchaai annexed a world,” Breq explains, “ethnic distinctions became irrelevant. Reality was messier.” A flashback in ‏Ancillary Justice‏ touches on this messiness: conflict erupts between the Tanmind and Orsians on the planet Shis’urna. Serving under Lt. Awn, ‏Justice of Toren ‏One Esk Nineteen observed firsthand the legacy of imperial occupation as the Tanmind repeatedly tried to curry favor with the Radchaai at the expense of the Orsians, going so far as to hatch a plot with Mianaai involving a secret cache of weapons: this was a small cog in the larger civil war, but it was the one responsible for the ‏Justice of Toren‏’s destruction. Breq’s arrival on Athoek Station, however, plunges her even deeper into the ethnic divisions that structure the quotidian realities of those living under the aegis of empire. Much like the Tanmind at best grudgingly tolerated the Orsians in ‏Ancillary Justice‏, the Xhai on Athoek Station have little patience for the Ychana who reside chiefly in the station’s Undergarden, a deliberately unsupervised forested area barely tolerated by the station’s administration. Breq begins to overhaul the station and tries to revitalize the Undergarden, actions which inflame Xhai prejudice and fuel Ychana resentment toward administrative overseers who govern from a distance. Breq tries to placate the divisive parties, but ethnic hatred runs deep, and in these moments there emerges an exploration of just who qualifies as a citizen in an empire where ethnic conflicts are tolerated, if not exacerbated, by imperial authorities.‏
    
    The flames of prejudice are further stoked when Breq travels downwell to Athoek. Breq learns firsthand about socioeconomic exploitation and elite privilege in her dealings with the prominent and wealthy Citizen Fosyf Denche and her out-of-control, spoiled clone-daughter Raughd, a Hilton/Kardashian/Jenner-style braggart who becomes the target of an assassination plot. The Denche family wealth is rooted in the harvesting, processing, and distribution of some of the most rarefied tea in Radchaai space, and, much like the spices of Frank Herbert’s ‏Dune‏, tea is a valuable commodity worth fighting over. Breq learns firsthand about the substandard living conditions for those laborers toiling in the plantation fields:‏
    There also shouldn’t have been such a sharp separation between the outdoor servants — all Valskaayan as far as I’d seen this morning and the day before — and the indoor, all Samirend with a few Xhais. Valskaay had been annexed a hundred years ago, and by now at least some of the first transportees or their children ought to have tested or worked their way into other positions.‏
    
    Breq is quickly brought up to speed regarding the impossible expectations for workers on the Denche plantation when she is bluntly told “no one’s going to stay picking tea if they can get away from it. Field hands are paid based on meeting a minimum weight of leaves picked. But the minimum is huge — it would take three very fast workers an entire day to pick so much.” Breq is gradually educated on worker exploitation and indentured slavery, organized work stoppage, and the creation and mobilization of workers’ unions. All the while, she attempts to untangle the Raughd assassination plot and keep abreast of diverse mysteries on Athoek Station, including a weird Ghost Gate that leads to an apparently empty sector in space, an ancient Notai artifact that emerges from the Ghost Gate, a human trafficking network that finds Valskaayan workers simply disappearing from Athoek, and, strangely enough, a beautiful tea set whose origins connect all these mysteries. While these enigmas will eventually tie into the Mianaai conflict, ‏Ancillary Sword ‏emerges as a powerful treatise about today’s global socioeconomic conditions, making it the most overtly political (and, for my tastes, the most satisfying) of the three novels. In our current age, where the legacies of imperialist colonialism continue to perpetuate socioeconomic disparities, worker exploitation, and concerted union busting, ‏Ancillary Sword ‏may be the most pertinent novel of the three.‏
    
    At the same time, ‏Ancillary Sword ‏is also the only novel in the trilogy that includes certain narrative disappointments. Breq has entirely personal reasons for going to Athoek Station: her former commanding officer Lt. Awn’s younger sister, Basnaaid Elming, serves as a Horticulture expert on Athoek Station, and Breq has a profound desire to reach out to her. As the events in ‏Ancillary Justice ‏reveal, ‏Justice of Toren ‏and all its ancillaries have been unknowing pawns in the Mianaai civil war. In the flashback to Shis’urna, ‏Justice of Toren ‏One Esk Nineteen slowly realizes the extent of this civil war when she learns of discrepancies in her AI’s official log, witnesses a mass execution, and (aboard the ‏Justice of Toren‏ in her ancillary form of One Var) murders Lt. Awn on Mianaai’s orders shortly before the ship itself is destroyed. As the surviving ancillary, Breq seeks out Lt. Awn’s sister on Athoek Station to confess her sins and achieve some kind of absolution (or punishment) for her actions. ‏Ancillary Sword‏, however, offers a largely unsatisfying resolution to a potential Breq-Basnaaid confrontation. The tension never attains the necessary gravitas, and forgiveness comes relatively easy to Breq when she saves Basnaaid’s life during a later skirmish aboard the space station. ‏Ancillary Sword ‏sets up a Breq-Basnaaid conflict, but it ultimately fails to deliver.‏
    
    However, the relationship Breq forms with Lt. Tisarwat throughout the novel more than makes up for this shortfall. Lt. Tisarwat mirrors Seivarden’s role from ‏Ancillary Justice‏, although her problems are more familiar to Breq than Seivarden’s drug recovery and confidence issues. Mianaai attempts to spy on Breq by turning the newly promoted Lt. Tisarwat into an ancillary, erasing her personality and consciousness as a consequence. Breq quickly suspects Mianaai’s treachery and frees Tisarwat from Mianaai’s control, which leaves Tisarwat in a similar predicament to Breq: she too was once part of an expansive mind, but now the lowly Tisarwat must struggle with her diminished state while simultaneously trying to reconnect with those parts of her that may have survived the ancillary conversion process. As with the Breq-Seivarden relationship in ‏Ancillary Justice‏, the Breq-Tisarwat relationship in ‏Ancillary Sword ‏offers layers of depth for Breq’s growing humanity, although Tisarwat is more than simply a replacement for Seivarden. Tisarwat acts as a strong secondary character, and in setting up a makeshift embassy in the Undergarden on Athoek Station, she is instrumental to bridging the ethnic conflicts aboard the station that Breq wasn’t able to reconcile. As ‏Ancillary Sword ‏and ‏Ancillary Mercy‏ show, Tisarwat embodies the hope that ages-old ethnic divisions can be negotiated and reconciled, although such reconciliation will be extremely difficult, require significant work, and entail personal cost.‏
    
    As befits the final book in the trilogy, ‏Ancillary Mercy ‏bears the difficult task of drawing the overall story to a satisfying close. The commendable conclusion pulls together the competing plots and subplots while introducing new characters, such as a new ancillary from the other side of the Ghost Gate, and intensifying the Mianaai schism. This conflict escalates when a third aspect of Lord Anaander Mianaai sets her sights on Breq in her own thirst for vengeance. This version of Mianaai is quite unlike her clone sisters and remains relatively underdeveloped, defined almost exclusively by her thirst for Breq’s blood, but ‏Ancillary Mercy ‏features an exciting interstellar confrontation between Breq’s ‏Mercy of Kalr ‏and several ‏Sword-‏class ships whose weapons grossly outmatch a ‏Mercy‏’s ordnance. ‏Ancillary Mercy ‏brings its share of casualties and embodies what fans of space opera have come to expect from this subgenre, but it also takes time to engage in an Asimovian-style debate about the Frankenstein complex and whether Artificial Intelligence entities should be untethered and allowed to live free from their programmed loyalties to the Radch empire. This important debate within the confines of the narrative helps to turn several tides in the ensuing conflicts. In lesser hands, ‏Ancillary Mercy ‏might collapse under the weight of all its moving pieces, but in a testament to Leckie’s narrative prowess, she is able to maintain stunning coherence amid all these elements and drive ‏Ancillary Mercy ‏to a wholly satisfying conclusion. In a wonderful metafictional (non-spoiler) moment, the final chapter of the book begins thus:‏
    Entertainments nearly always end with triumph or disaster — happiness achieved, or total, tragic defeat precluding any hope of it. But there is always more after the ending — always the next morning and the next, always changes, losses and gains. Always one step after the other. Until the one true ending that none of us can escape. But even that ending is only a small one, large as it looms for us. There is still the next morning for everyone else. For the vast majority of the rest of the universe, that ending might as well not ever have happened. Every ending is an arbitrary one. Every ending is, from another angle, not really an ending.‏ 
    
    Ancillary Mercy is simultaneously an ending and not an ending. It provides a degree of closure on a stellar trilogy whose immense scope awaits (even demands) further explorations, which we’ve already started to see in such short stories as “Night’s Slow Poison” (2012), “She Commands Me and I Obey” (2014), and at least one forthcoming novel, due for release in the fall of 2017. The Imperial Radch trilogy is thoughtful, exciting, well paced, fascinating, and awe inspiring in its narrative intricacies. It exemplifies not only what the best space opera can achieve, but also the best of what science fiction can offer.‏

    <br>
Dystopian fiction often assumes that in the future sexism and racism will be figured out. Just look at The Hunger Games.<br>
 Katniss is never questioned for being a badass woman with a powerful bow. The riots that are so racially tense in the film–echoing disturbing images of plantation slaves–are not explicitly about race in the books. I find it rather naïve to believe that humanity will progress so far in terms of gender and racial equality only to succumb to a big government that tamps everyone’s rights. History shows that this is not how dictatorships work. Equally frustrating is how rarely dystopian fiction, and sci-fi in general, goes beyond white, Western experience. Even if the United States remains a superpower and American corporations continue to dominate much of the market, the rest of the world will continue to exist. Fiction needn’t ignore that.‏
Imagine my joy when I discovered ‏The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi. Masquerading as a sci-fi thriller, 
Bacigalupi’s fantastic debut is actually a big issues novel.<br>
 It is an intelligent book, political without being polemical. Beautifully written, it neatly folds complex ideas about gender,
  race and ethnicity into the plot without giving solutions, acknowledging that in a broken future there’s no reason to assume that our understanding of one another will be any less broken.‏
The novel takes place in Thailand a couple centuries from now.
 Genetically modified fruits and vegetables are the only kind available, the word “natural” has lost all meaning, calorie companies control the global food market, gas-fueled vehicles belong only to the mega-wealthy or the military, and electricity is provided by spring-based power and the transfer of kinetic energy. Thailand is one of the last bastions of independence from the American calorie companies, corporations whose aggression and power echo today’s tobacco and oil industries.‏
The issues of climate change, ecology, and the future of humanity’s food and energy are central to the novel.<br>
 Bacigalupi throws the reader into a world where cheshires, chameleon-like genetically engineered cats, roam the streets, feed on the dead, and breed like bunnies, and megodonts, elephant-like creatures, fuel factory energy. U-Tex rice, engineered in Texas and shipped around the world, is a dietary staple, and two Thai governmental bodies, Trade and Environment, are at war. The greedy Trade Ministry is eager to open the city to foreign markets while the cautious Environment Ministry (equally greedy but working on the smaller local scale of endless bribes) enforces borders in order to prevent the spread of mutated epidemics that ravage food. Bacigalupi reminds us that the food so many of us take for granted is human fuel, literal energy to be consumed and used. Food is as intimate to us as our bodies, and Bacigalupi paints a future in which it is not only scarce, but downright dangerous.‏
Besides the powerful ecological criticism that Bacigalupi brings to the fore, he gets at gender, race, and the very meaning of being human. Of his main characters, only one, arguably the villain of the piece, is white and Western. The rest are Thai (Jaidee Rojjanasukchai, Kanya), Japanese (Emiko) or Chinese (Hock Seng). This is refreshing in and of itself, but what is better is that these aren’t empty symbols of diversity, but rather complex characters with shifting agendas, desires, and vulnerabilities. If there is one thing that Bacigalupi does best – and he does a lot of things very, very well – it is creating truly three-dimensional characters whom I found myself rooting for, identifying with, and sometimes despising.‏
Particularly important is Emiko, the windup girl of the title.<br>
 Invented by Japanese scientists, New People, or windups, are genetically engineered creatures grown in test tubes and trained 
 from birth to be obedient to their owners.<br>
  Some are easy to identify as biological machines: the “ten-hand” workers who tend the fields of Japan, for example. Some are dangerous, like the military grade windups fighting in Vietnam or the windup attack hounds. And some are merely beautiful, useful heechy-keechy, as they’re derogatorily called by the Thai. Emiko belongs to this last category. With genes encoded with the need to serve and obey, she was once owned by a Japanese businessman who brought her to his bed and told her not to be ashamed of who she was.‏
Then he abandoned her in Thailand. She might have been better off being mulched.<br>
 Her kind are not only looked down on, they are illegal in Thailand, and while she looks human,
  her movements are “stutter-stop flash-bulb strange” and visibly mark her as a windup.<br>
   If she moves very slowly, concentrating all the while, she can achieve smooth gestures, but otherwise she is a tick-tock 
   creature designed to never be mistaken for a “real” human. Predictably, perhaps, the only place a New Person like Emiko can 
   survive is in a brothel, where men pay good money to watch her beaten and raped by another prostitute, an act she performs night after 
   night. <br>They pay even more, if they dare, for the gauche and kinky experience of sleeping with her.<br>
When Emiko is first introduced, it is clear her body is not hers to control. She is genetically programed to orgasm and so she climaxes onstage for her audience, even as tears leak from her eyes and her contorted limbs ache. Her perfect skin is smooth because it lacks pores, and so, because she cannot sweat, Emiko overheats, a further parallel between her and simple machines. But, like humans, Emiko feels, thinks, eats, and shits. Though Thais believe Emiko doesn’t have a soul, Bacigalupi voices her thoughts, her psyche, her instincts, and her need to rebel. Except for her physicality, it is impossible to distinguish between her and a human.‏
Does Emiko represent another race? Another species? A new kind of human or a very intelligent machine? Racial parallels are inevitable; prejudice requires viewing the Other as less than human. Emiko embodies this complicated idea by being human-created rather than human-born, and she does so in a world fraught with tension between Thais, Chinese refugees and Americans. In other words, Bacigalupi doesn’t spoon-feed some false racial dichotomy, nor does he shy away from confronting his readers with the twisted logic that fuels racist behavior.‏
Fear is the emotion that Emiko ultimately raises in others, especially after she sets herself free by discovering that despite her training, she can disobey and even harm those who have hurt her
